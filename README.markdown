UR!KA - Social Inspiration
================

UR!KA was built by Luke Williams in 2010/11 as part of his final year at the University of Kent. It was built using Code Igniter and jQuery libraries, as well as many, many hours of sitting in front of Notepad++ on a tough little laptop.

### About this repository

This is (for now) a private repository to the source code of UR!KA. I've got a couple of upgrades to build so starting some proper version control made sense.
